This project is an exploration into the world of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), a critical field in industry dedicated to predicting asset health to prevent failures and minimize downtime. The dataset, sourced from NASA's Prognostics Center of Excellence, is a well-known public set used for modeling asset degradation. It includes Run-to-Failure simulated data from turbofan jet engines, generated using C-MAPSS, under different combinations of operational conditions and fault modes. The dataset contains several sensor readings that help in characterizing the evolution of faults. The task is to leverage this data to predict the likelihood of machine failure within specific periods: 30, 90, 180, or 365 days. To tackle this challenge, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) suitable for time-series data, was used.

The project's novelty lies in its application of a Bidirectional LSTM network to predict machine failures. This advanced technique allows the LSTM layers to consider information from both past and future time steps simultaneously, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the time-series data and thus enhancing the model's predictive performance. In real-world applications, such an approach is crucial in sectors such as manufacturing, energy, and transportation, where equipment maintenance is paramount. By predicting machine failure probabilities within specific periods, the model enables strategic planning of maintenance activities, reducing downtime and related costs. Additionally, it assists with inventory management by predicting the need for spare parts based on machine failure forecasts.

In conclusion, this project is a prime example of the synergy between Machine Learning and Industrial IoT (IIoT). It demonstrates how advanced machine learning techniques, like Bidirectional LSTM, can transform sensor data into actionable insights, leading to optimized operations and cost savings. By applying these techniques, companies can transition from reactive to preventive maintenance strategies, enhancing their resource management and overall operational efficiency. Therefore, this model makes a significant contribution to the evolving domain of predictive maintenance and IIoT.
